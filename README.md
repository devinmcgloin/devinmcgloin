### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer in California, previously New York City and Dublin. Aiming for a constant state of play.

Working on [Mona](https://mo.na), [Arena](https://arenahq.io) and [numerous other things](https://devin.website/work), previously [Intercom](https://intercom.com). I'm interested in working at small companies, having more skin in the game, and owning the experience end to end.

I'm an occasional backpacker, [artist](https://devin.website/art) and [photographer](https://devin.website/photos). I sometimes write, and put it up on my [blog](https://devin.website/words).

I want to spend time building / restoring physical things, but increasingly find myself building on computers. I have todo list items like "Restore a Porsche 964", "Build a house", and "Earn a private pilot license".
